# hello-world
Repository for introductory web developing code and research. 

Hi everyone!

Earnthefuture here! I am a beginner coder with an interest in web development. I'm looking to learn the most I can about web development using Udemy.com and use my acquired skills to do freelance work for aspiring musicians, professionals, etc. Basically I want to make websites for anyone that wants one! I firmly believe anyone who wants to sell a product, create content, or enter the professional job market needs their own website; it's the best way to put all your pertient information in one place while catching the attention of potential employers/your audience/your customer base while setting up a communication hub at the same time. 

I hope to glean lots of knowledge from others and to help others once I become more experienced.
